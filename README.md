# legs.js

A JavaScript homage to the [RobotLegs][robotlegs] micro-architecture.

## What legs.js *is*

Totally being re-done, **that's** what!

## Legs.Class

**legs-js** comes with a super-simple class implementation inspired by projects like 
[js-oo][js-oo] and [klass][klass]. It's not nearly as full-featured as either of those
libraries, but it is enough to define and extend classes with accurate inheritance.
